Error on my part caused problems with local and remote repositories, leading to loss of work. I thought I had pushed my work successfully, but such was not the case - I had an empty folder with the correct name in my remote.
Discovered this after having to delete local files and attempting to restore from remote.

Created new remote repo and starting again.
